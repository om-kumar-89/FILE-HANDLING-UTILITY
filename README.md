Mentor : NEELA SANTHOSH

Description:

    The program demonstrates basic file handling operations in Java using the FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader classes. It works with a text file named sample.txt and performs three main tasks: writing, reading, and appending data to the file.

First, the program creates (or overwrites) the file and writes a line of text into it using FileWriter. After successfully writing, it opens the same file for reading using FileReader wrapped inside BufferedReader, and then displays the file content line-by-line on the console. Next, the program reopens the file in append mode to add additional text at the end of the existing content without deleting it. All file operations are enclosed in a try–catch block to handle any IOException that may occur, ensuring the program runs safely and reports errors if needed.

This program effectively demonstrates how to create, write, read, and update text files in Java while following proper exception handling and resource-closing practices.

Tools & Technologies Used:

  Programming Language: Java

  Editor/IDE: vs code

  JDK Version: Java Development Kit 17 (or any version 8 and above)

  Libraries Used: java.io.*(optionally for future extensions)

  
Conclusion:
This project is a practical introduction to file management using Java. It builds a strong foundation for understanding how data can be stored, retrieved, and manipulated in local systems. The simplicity and clarity of the code make it perfect for students aiming to enhance their Java skills and understand real-world application basics.
